For discussion regarding the roadmap see [#13](../issues/13).

# PyRolL Core

## Version 1.1 "Spacial Resolution"

- implement concept of strip element/disk element to enable spacial resolution in rolling direction
- enable possibilities for:
  - one-dimensional Karman-type tension and force calculation
  - local spreading and roll contact
  - one-dimensional thermal modelling

## Version 2.0 "Asymmetric Rolling"

- implement data structures for asymmetric rolling
  - distinct working rolls
  - drop symmetry assumptions in current code

## Not Scheduled

- 3-roll passes for wire and tubes
